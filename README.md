# Job Hazard Analysis Full Stack App by Francis Michael LaRosa

This project uses React for the Frontend styled with React Bootstrap.
The BackEnd was created using Spring Boot with a MySQL DataBase

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `mvn spring-boot:run`

**You must have maven installed to run this app**


Runs the app (Please Note this may take some time as it will be building both the React and Spring Boot portions)
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

As you will see, I did not have a chance to implement all of the CRUD functionality on the FrontEnd.
However please note the Server DOES have complete CRUD capabilites created, I just did not have time to implement them all into React.
